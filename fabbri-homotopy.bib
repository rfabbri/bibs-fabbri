The cost of continuation depends on a renormalized condition length, defined as a line integral of the condition number along all the lifted renormalized paths. The theory developed in this paper leads to a continuation algorithm tracking all the solutions between two generic systems with the same structure. The algorithm is randomized, in the sense that it follows a random path between the two systems. The probability of success is one. In order to produce an expected cost bound, several invariants depending solely on the supports of the equations are introduced. For instance, the mixed area is a quermassintegral that generalizes surface area in the same way that mixed volume generalizes ordinary volume. The facet gap measures for each 1-cone in the fan and for each support polytope, how close is the supporting hyperplane to the nearest vertex. Once the supports are fixed, the expected cost depends on the input coefficients solely through two invariants: the renormalized toric condition number and the imbalance of the absolute values of the coefficients. This leads to a nonuniform polynomial complexity bound for polynomial solving in terms of those two invariants.}",

	abstract = {This paper investigates the cost of solving systems of sparse polynomial equations by homotopy continuation. First, a space of systems of n-variate polynomial equations is specified through n monomial bases. The natural locus for the roots of those systems is known to be a certain toric variety. This variety is a compactification of {\$}{\$}({$\backslash$}mathbb {\{}C{\}}{$\backslash$}setminus {$\backslash$}{\{}0{$\backslash$}{\}})\^{}n{\$}{\$}, dependent on the monomial bases. A toric Newton operator is defined on that toric variety. Smale's alpha theory is generalized to provide criteria of quadratic convergence. Two condition numbers are defined, and a higher derivative estimate is obtained in this setting. The Newton operator and related condition numbers turn out to be invariant through a group action related to the momentum map. A homotopy algorithm is given and is proved to terminate after a number of Newton steps which is linear on the condition length of the lifted homotopy path. This generalizes a result from Shub (Found Comput Math 9(2):171--178, 2009. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10208-007-9017-6).},
