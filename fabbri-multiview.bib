% Abstract:
% Shape from shading is a classical inverse problem in computer vision. It is
% inherently ill-defined and, in different formulations, it depends on the assumed
% light source direction. In contrast to these mathematical difficulties, we
% introduce a novel mathematical formulation for calculating local surface shape
% based on covariant derivatives of the shading flow field, rather than the
% customary integral minimization or P.D.E approaches.Working with the shading
% flow field rather than the original image intensities is important to both
% neurogeometry and neurophysiology. To make the calculations concrete we assume a
% Lambertian model for image formation, butwe do not make global light source
% positional assumptions. In particular, for smooth surfaces in generic position,
% we show that second derivatives of brightness are independent of the light
% sources and can be directly related to surface properties. We use these
% measurements to define the matching local family of surfaces that could result
% from a given shading patch. In total our results change the emphasis from
% seeking a single, well-define solution to an ill-posed problem to characterizing
% the ambiguity in possible solutions to this problem. The result is relevant both
% mathematically and perceptually, because we then show how the equations simplify
% and the ambiguity reduces are certain critical points of intensity. We conclude
% with a discussion of image reconstruction at these critical points.

pages="212--234",
abstract="There are two main strategies for solving correspondence problems in computer vision: sparse local feature based approaches and dense global energy based methods. While sparse feature based methods are often used for estimating the fundamental matrix by matching a small set of sophistically optimised interest points, dense energy based methods mark the state of the art in optical flow computation. The goal of our paper is to show that this separation into different application domains is unnecessary and can be bridged in a natural way. As a first contribution we present a new application of dense optical flow for estimating the fundamental matrix. Comparing our results with those obtained by feature based techniques we identify cases in which dense methods have advantages over sparse approaches. Motivated by these promising results we propose, as a second contribution, a new variational model that recovers the fundamental matrix and the optical flow simultaneously as the minimisers of a single energy functional. In experiments we show that our coupled approach is able to further improve the estimates of both the fundamental matrix and the optical flow. Our results prove that dense variational methods can be a serious alternative even in classical application domains of sparse feature based approaches.",

year="1998",
abstract="Corresponding image points of a rigid object in a discrete sequence of images fulfil the so-called multilinear constraint. In this paper the continuous time analogue of this constraint, for a continuous stream of images, is introduced and studied. The constraint links the Taylor series expansion of the motion of the image points with the Taylor series expansion of the relative motion and orientation between the object and the camera. The analysis is done both for calibrated and uncalibrated cameras. Two simplifications are also presented for the uncalibrated camera case. One simplification is made using an affine reduction and the so-called kinetic depths. The second simplification is based upon a projective reduction with respect to the image of a planar configuration. The analysis shows that the constraint involving second-order derivatives are needed to determine camera motion. Experiments with real and simulated data are also presented.",

abstract="We provide a theoretical proof showing that under a proportional noise model, the discrete eight point algorithm behaves similarly to the differential eight point algorithm when the motion is small. This implies that the discrete algorithm can handle arbitrarily small motion for a general scene, as long as the noise decreases proportionally with the amount of image motion and the proportionality constant is small enough. This stability result extends to all normalized variants of the eight point algorithm. Using simulations, we show that given arbitrarily small motions and proportional noise regime, the normalized eight point algorithms outperform their differential counterparts by a large margin. Using real data, we show that in practical small motion problems involving optical flow, these discrete structure from motion (SFM) algorithms also provide better estimates than their differential counterparts, even when the motion magnitudes reach sub-pixel level. The better performance of these normalized discrete variants means that there is much to recommend them as differential SFM algorithms that are linear and normalized.",

abstract="This article studies 3-D interpretation of optical flow induced by a general camera motion relative to a surface of general shape. First, we describe, using the ``image sphere representation,'' an analytical procedure that yields an exact solution when the data are exact: we solve theepipolar equation written in terms of theessential parameters and thetwisted optical flow. Introducing a simple model of noise, we then show that the solution is ``statistically biased.'' In order to remove the statistical bias, we propose an algorithm calledrenormalization, which automatically adjusts to unknown image noise. A brief discussion is also given to thecritical surface that yields ambiguous 3-D interpretations and the use of theimage plane representation.",

Under certain assumptions this procedure allows the egomotionand some intrinsic parameters of the camera to be determined solely from theinstantaneous positions and velocities of a set of image features. The proposedmethod relies on the use of a differential epipolar equation that relatesoptical flow to the egomotion and the internal geometry of the camera. A detailedderivation of this equation is presented. This aspect of the work may be seenas a recasting into an analytical framework of the pivotal research of {\textless}author order$=$"1"{\textgreater}  {\textless}name{\textgreater}    {\textless}last{\textgreater}Vi\'{e}ville{\textless}/last{\textgreater}  {\textless}/name{\textgreater}{\textless}/author{\textgreater}{\textless}author order$=$"2"{\textgreater}  {\textless}name{\textgreater}    {\textless}last{\textgreater}Faugeras{\textless}/last{\textgreater}  {\textless}/name{\textgreater}{\textless}/author{\textgreater} \[Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Computer Vision (IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, Calif., 1995), pp. 750--756\].The information about the camera's egomotion and internal geometry entersthe differential epipolar equation via two matrices. It emerges that the opticalflow determines the composite ratio of some of the entries of the two matrices.It is shown that a camera with unknown focal length undergoing arbitrary motioncan be self-calibrated by means of closed-form expressions in the compositeratio. The corresponding formulas specify five egomotion parameters as wellas the focal length and its derivative. A procedure is presented for reconstructingthe viewed scene, up to a scale factor, from the derived self-calibrationdata and the optical flow data. Experimental results are given to demonstratethe correctness of the approach.},

abstract="This paper deals with the problem of self-calibrating a moving camera with constant parameters. We propose a new set of quartic trivariate polynomial equations in the unknown coordinates of the plane at infinity derived under the no-skew assumption. Our new equations allow to further enforce the constancy of the principal point across all images while retrieving the plane at infinity. Six such polynomials, four of which are independent, are obtained for each triplet of images. The proposed equations can be solved along with the so-called modulus constraints and allow to improve the performance of existing methods.",

abstract="We review the different techniques known for doing exact computations on polynomial systems. Some are based on the use of Gr{\"o}bner bases and linear algebra, others on the more classical resultants and its modern counterparts. Many theoretical examples of the use of these techniques are given. Furthermore, a full set of examples of applications in the domain of artificial vision, where many constraints boil down to polynomial systems, are presented. Emphasis is also put on very recent methods for determining the number of (isolated) real and complex roots of such systems.",

abstract = {We address the problem of camera motion and 3D structure reconstruction from line correspondences across multiple views, from initialization to final bundle adjustment. One of the main difficulties when dealing with line features is their algebraic representation. First, we consider the triangulation problem. Based on Plücker coordinates to represent the 3D lines, we propose a maximum likelihood algorithm, relying on linearizing the Plücker constraint and on a Plücker correction procedure, computing the closest Plücker coordinates to a given 6-vector. Second, we consider the bundle adjustment problem, which is essentially a nonlinear optimization process on camera motion and 3D line parameters. Previous overparameterizations of 3D lines induce gauge freedoms and/or internal consistency constraints. We propose the orthonormal representation, which allows handy nonlinear optimization of 3D lines using the minimum four parameters with an unconstrained optimization engine. We compare our algorithms to existing ones on simulated and real data. Results show that our triangulation algorithm outperforms standard linear and bias-corrected quasi-linear algorithms, and that bundle adjustment using our orthonormal representation yields results similar to the standard maximum likelihood trifocal tensor algorithm, while being usable for any number of views.}

% abstract = {We present the first algorithm capable of automatically lifting real-world, vector-format, industrial design sketches into 3D. Targeting real-world sketches raises numerous challenges due to inaccuracies, use of overdrawn strokes, and construction lines. In particular, while construction lines convey important 3D information, they add significant clutter and introduce multiple accidental 2D intersections. Our algorithm exploits the geometric cues provided by the construction lines and lifts them to 3D by computing their intended 3D intersections and depths. Once lifted to 3D, these lines provide valuable geometric constraints that we leverage to infer the 3D shape of other artist drawn strokes. The core challenge we address is inferring the 3D connectivity of construction and other lines from their 2D projections by separating 2D intersections into 3D intersections and accidental occlusions. We efficiently address this complex combinatorial problem using a dedicated search algorithm that leverages observations about designer drawing pREFERENCES, and uses those to explore only the most likely solutions of the 3D intersection detection problem. We demonstrate that our separator outputs are of comparable quality to human annotations, and that the 3D structures we recover enable a range of design editing and visualization applications, including novel view synthesis and 3D-aware scaling of the depicted shape.},

% abstract = {Popular Virtual Reality (VR) tools allow users to draw varying-width, ribbonlike 3D brush strokes by moving a hand-held controller in 3D space. Artists frequently use dense collections of such strokes to draw virtual 3D shapes. We propose SurfaceBrush, a surfacing method that converts such VR drawings into user-intended manifold free-form 3D surfaces, providing a novel approach for modeling 3D shapes. The inputs to our method consist of dense collections of artist-drawn stroke ribbons described by the positions and normals of their central polylines, and ribbon widths. These inputs are highly distinct from those handled by existing surfacing frameworks and exhibit different sparsity and error patterns, necessitating a novel surfacing approach. We surface the input stroke drawings by identifying and leveraging local coherence between nearby artist strokes. In particular, we observe that strokes intended to be adjacent on the artist imagined surface often have similar tangent directions along their respective polylines. We leverage this local stroke direction consistency by casting the computation of the user-intended manifold surface as a constrained matching problem on stroke polyline vertices and edges. We first detect and smoothly connect adjacent similarly-directed sequences of stroke edges producing one or more manifold partial surfaces. We then complete the surfacing process by identifying and connecting adjacent similarly directed edges along the borders of these partial surfaces. We confirm the usability of the SurfaceBrush interface and the validity of our drawing analysis via an observational study. We validate our stroke surfacing algorithm by demonstrating an array of manifold surfaces computed by our framework starting from a range of inputs of varying complexity, and by comparing our outputs to reconstructions computed using alternative means.},

% abstract = {While free-hand sketching has long served as an efficient representation to convey characteristics of an object, they are often subjective, deviating significantly from realistic representations. Moreover, sketches are not consistent for arbitrary viewpoints, making it hard to catch 3D shapes. We propose 3Dooole, generating descriptive and view-consistent sketch images given multi-view images of the target object. Our method is based on the idea that a set of 3D strokes can efficiently represent 3D structural information and render view-consistent 2D sketches. We express 2D sketches as a union of view-independent and view-dependent components. 3D cubic B\'{e}zier curves indicate view-independent 3D feature lines, while contours of superquadrics express a smooth outline of the volume of varying viewpoints. Our pipeline directly optimizes the parameters of 3D stroke primitives to minimize perceptual losses in a fully differentiable manner. The resulting sparse set of 3D strokes can be rendered as abstract sketches containing essential 3D characteristic shapes of various objects. We demonstrate that 3Doodle can faithfully express concepts of the original images compared with recent sketch generation approaches.1},

% abstract = {Leaves, crucial for plant physiology, exhibit various morphological traits that meet diverse functional needs. Traditional leaf morphology quantification, largely 2-dimensional (2D), has not fully captured the 3-dimensional (3D) aspects of leaf function. Despite improvements in 3D data acquisition, accurately depicting leaf morphologies, particularly at the edges, is difficult. This study proposes a method for 3D leaf edge reconstruction, combining 2D image segmentation with curve-based 3D reconstruction. Utilizing deep-learning-based instance segmentation for 2D edge detection, structure from motion for estimation of camera positions and orientations, leaf correspondence identification for matching leaves among images, and curve-based 3D reconstruction for estimating 3D curve fragments, the method assembles 3D curve fragments into a leaf edge model through B-spline curve fitting. The method's performances were evaluated on both virtual and actual leaves, and the results indicated that small leaves and high camera noise pose greater challenges to reconstruction. We developed guidelines for setting a reliability threshold for curve fragments, considering factors occlusion, leaf size, the number of images, and camera error; the number of images had a lesser impact on this threshold compared to others. The method was effective for lobed leaves and leaves with fewer than 4 holes. However, challenges still existed when dealing with morphologies exhibiting highly local variations, such as serrations. This nondestructive approach to 3D leaf edge reconstruction marks an advancement in the quantitative analysis of plant morphology. It is a promising way to capture whole-plant architecture by combining 2D and 3D phenotyping approaches adapted to the target anatomical structures.}}

The input to our pipeline consists of 3D strokes' polyline vertices and their timestamps as the 4th dimension, along with additional metadata recorded throughout sketching. Inspired by architectural sketching practices, our pipeline combines a classifier and two clustering models to achieve its goal. First, with a set of extracted hand-engineered features from the sketch, the classifier recognizes the type of individual strokes between those depicting boundaries (Shape strokes) and those depicting enclosed areas (Scribble strokes). Next, the two clustering models parse strokes of each type into distinct groups, each representing an individual edge or face of the intended architectural object. Curve networks are then formed through topology recovery of consolidated Shape clusters and surfaced using Scribble clusters guiding the cycle discovery. Our evaluation is threefold: We confirm the usability of the Strokes2Surface pipeline in architectural design use cases via a user study, we validate our choice of features via statistical analysis and ablation studies on our collected dataset, and we compare our outputs against a range of reconstructions computed using alternative methods.},

These 3D sketches are readily perceived as piecewise smooth surfaces by viewers, but are poorly handled by existing 3D surface techniques tailored to well-connected curve networks or sparse point sets. Our algorithm is aligned with human tendency to imagine the strokes as a small set of simple smooth surfaces joined along stroke boundaries. Starting with an initial proxy surface, we iteratively segment the surface into smooth patches joined sharply along some strokes, and optimize these patches to fit surrounding strokes. Our evaluation is fourfold: we demonstrate the impact of various algorithmic parameters, we evaluate our method on synthetic sketches with known ground truth surfaces, we compare to prior art, and we show compelling results on more than 50 designs from a diverse set of 3D sketch sources.},

% abstract = {CAD modeling, despite being the industry-standard, remains restricted to usage by skilled practitioners due to two key barriers. First, the user must be able to mentally parse a final shape into a valid sequence of supported CAD commands; and second, the user must be sufficiently conversant with CAD software packages to be able to execute the corresponding CAD commands. As a step towards addressing both these challenges, we present Free2CAD wherein the user can simply sketch the final shape and our system parses the input strokes into a sequence of commands expressed in a simplified CAD language. When executed, these commands reproduce the sketched object. Technically, we cast sketch-based CAD modeling as a sequence-to-sequence translation problem, for which we leverage the powerful Transformers neural network architecture. Given the sequence of pen strokes as input, we introduce the new task of grouping strokes that correspond to individual CAD operations. We combine stroke grouping with geometric fitting of the operation parameters, such that intermediate groups are geometrically corrected before being reused, as context, for subsequent steps in the sequence inference. Although trained on synthetically-generated data, we demonstrate that Free2CAD generalizes to sketches created from real-world CAD models as well as to sketches drawn by novice users.Code and data are at https://github.com/Enigma-li/Free2CAD.},

    Abstract= {Augmented reality has incredible potential to change the way we interact with information. Smart mobile devices have enabled us to be constantly connected to an ever expanding source of information known as the internet. Augmented Reality devices can present a method for organizing this information and ensure that relevant information is present in the location where it is most useful. Similarly, the spatial organization of information alongside physical objects can present new forms of creativity and artistry. These devices use computer vision algorithms to understand the structure of objects in the world as well as the devices' location relative to these objects. This understanding is used to display virtual objects in such a way as to appear present in the physical world. While these algorithms present a viable solution in many situations, they still have many failure cases that can prevent the ubiquitous adoption of these devices. 

This thesis discusses methods for improving the localization and mapping capabilities of these Augmented Reality devices by exploiting the structure that is present in many man-made environments. A discussion of some open problems in augmented reality is presented in the context of the open source package OpenARK. The remainder of thesis discusses methods for improving localization and mapping and 3D reconstruction. A method is presented for incorporating planar structures from a Time of Flight depth sensor into a state of the art Visual Inertial Odometry algorithm. This algorithm is demonstrated to improve localization accuracy in low light and low texture environments and maintain realtime performance on a mobile device with limited Time of Flight depth sensing range and limited compute resources. A method is presented for enabling the realtime matching of image wireframes. Image wireframes represent the junctions, lines and intersection relationships that form the structure of the scene. This algorithm exploits these relationships to improve the matching of image wireframes beyond standard feature matching. This method is further demonstrated to be capable of exploiting the additional constraints introduced by multiple cameras.},
